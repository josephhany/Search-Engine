VIP NOTE:

To run the project properly please use any windows compiler (preferably code blocks), but don’t run it on linux because the txt or csv files format gets corrupted on linux. If you faced any problem running this program please send me on this email joseph_boulis@aucegypt.edu.

There is two cpp and excutable files one opening txt files and the other csv files choose whatever format that suits your testing
